# Work Product Grading Test - Summary of Findings

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Reviewer:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED - Ready for Implementation

---

## TL;DR

✅ **Good news!** All the functionality you need for the work product grading test is already implemented and working in `@verdikta/common@1.3.1`. No code changes required - we can proceed directly to building the test.

---

## What You Asked For

You want to create a test/demo that:
1. **Primary archive** contains task description + jury config + reference to external rubric via IPFS
2. **Work product bCID** contains the submitted work
3. **Rubric (IPFS)** is fetched automatically from IPFS (not passed on blockchain)
4. AI jury grades the work against the rubric

---

## Critical Question Answered

### "Does the manifestParser automatically fetch IPFS files from the `additional` section?"

**Answer: YES! ✅**

**Source:** `/root/verdikta-common/src/utils/manifestParser.js` lines 88-127

**How it works:**
```javascript
// When the parser encounters this in manifest.json:
{
  "additional": [
    {
      "name": "gradingRubric",
      "type": "ipfs/cid",
      "hash": "QmRubricCID...",
      "description": "Grading rubric"
    }
  ]
}

// The parser automatically:
// 1. Detects the hash field and type: "ipfs/cid"
// 2. Calls ipfsClient.fetchFromIPFS(file.hash)
// 3. Downloads the file to local temp storage
// 4. Returns an object with absolute path:
{
  name: "gradingRubric",
  type: "image/webp", // Note: hardcoded, but aiClient detects actual type
  path: "/tmp/verdikta-extract-xyz/additional_QmRubricCID",
  description: "Grading rubric"
}

// 5. The aiClient can then read the file using the absolute path
```

## What You Can Build Now

### 1. Primary Archive Structure
```
primary-grading-task.zip
├── manifest.json          # Contains jury config + bCID mapping + rubric reference
└── primary_query.json     # Task description and instructions
```

**manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "Work Product Grading System",
  "primary": {
    "filename": "primary_query.json"
  },
  "juryParameters": {
    "NUMBER_OF_OUTCOMES": 5,
    "AI_NODES": [
      {
        "AI_MODEL": "gpt-4o",
        "AI_PROVIDER": "OpenAI",
        "NO_COUNTS": 1,
        "WEIGHT": 0.6
      },
      {
        "AI_MODEL": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        "AI_PROVIDER": "Anthropic",
        "NO_COUNTS": 1,
        "WEIGHT": 0.4
      }
    ],
    "ITERATIONS": 1
  },
  "additional": [
    {
      "name": "gradingRubric",
      "type": "ipfs/cid",
      "hash": "ACTUAL_RUBRIC_CID_HERE",
      "description": "Detailed grading rubric"
    }
  ],
  "bCIDs": {
    "submittedWork": "Work product submitted for evaluation"
  }
}
```

### 2. Work Product Archive (bCID)
```
work-product-submission.zip
├── manifest.json
├── primary_query.json     # The actual submitted work
└── submission.py          # Optional: the actual file being graded
```

### 3. Rubric File (IPFS)
Upload a text/markdown file to IPFS first:
```markdown
GRADING RUBRIC FOR PYTHON FUNCTION

Correctness (40 points):
- Function produces correct output
- Handles edge cases properly

Code Quality (30 points):
- Clean, readable code
- Good variable names

Efficiency (20 points):
- Reasonable time complexity

Documentation (10 points):
- Clear docstring
- Usage examples

SCORING:
90-100: A (Excellent)
80-89:  B (Good)
70-79:  C (Satisfactory)
60-69:  D (Needs Improvement)
0-59:   F (Unsatisfactory)
```

### 4. Request Format
```
PRIMARY_CID,WORKPRODUCT_CID
```

---

## Workflow

1. **Upload rubric** to IPFS → get `RUBRIC_CID`
2. **Create primary archive** with rubric reference → upload to IPFS → get `PRIMARY_CID`
3. **Create work product archive** → upload to IPFS → get `WORKPRODUCT_CID`
4. **Send request** to adapter: `PRIMARY_CID,WORKPRODUCT_CID`
5. **System processes:**
   - Downloads both archives
   - Fetches rubric from IPFS automatically
   - Combines task + rubric + work product
   - Sends to AI jury
   - Returns grade with justification

---

## Minor Issue Found

**Location:** `/root/verdikta-common/src/utils/manifestParser.js` line 107

The MIME type is hardcoded as `'image/webp'` when fetching IPFS files. This doesn't break functionality (because aiClient detects the actual type from file content), but it could be cleaner.

**Impact:** LOW - Test will work fine  
**Action:** Optional - could fix in a future PR to verdikta-common

---

## Recommendations

1. **Rubric Format:** Use plain text or markdown for best AI readability
2. **File Sizes:** Keep rubric < 5KB, work product < 50KB for initial tests
3. **Outcomes:** Use 5 clear grade levels (A, B, C, D, F) for multi-outcome voting
4. **Error Handling:** If rubric fetch fails, the entire evaluation should fail (rubric is essential)

---

## Ready to Proceed?

The planning document is complete and all technical questions are answered. The next steps would be:

1. **Your review** of the approach and design
2. **Any changes** you'd like to make to the plan
3. **Build the test** - create the actual files and test code
4. **Test execution** - validate end-to-end

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with building the test, or if you have questions/changes to the design!
