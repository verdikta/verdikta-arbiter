# Fixed Chainlink Operator Contract for Verdikta

This project contains a fixed implementation of the Chainlink Operator contract that properly implements the `fulfillOracleRequest3` function.

## The Issue

The original implementation in the automated deployment script used `abi.encodePacked` for the callback in `fulfillOracleRequest3`, while the job spec expected `abi.encodeWithSelector` with the request ID as the first parameter.

## The Fix

Changed from:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = callbackAddress.call(abi.encodePacked(callbackFunctionId, data));
```

To:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = callbackAddress.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(callbackFunctionId, requestId, data));
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd fixed-operator-test
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file from the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to include:
- Your private key (without 0x prefix)
- Your Infura API key
- The Chainlink node address (already included)

### 3. Deploy the Fixed Contract

```bash
npx truffle migrate --network baseSepolia
```

### 4. Authorize the Node

```bash
npx truffle exec scripts/authorize-node.js --network baseSepolia
```

### 5. Update Your Client Application

Update your client application to use the new Operator contract address in your requests.

## Testing

After deploying the fixed Operator contract, you should be able to make requests from your client application without transaction reverts.

## Next Steps

If this fix resolves the issue, you should update the original `deploy-contracts-automated.sh` script to use this fixed implementation for future deployments.
