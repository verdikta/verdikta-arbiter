Plaintiff: I'm interested in buying some Ethereum from you.
Defendant: Great, I have 10 ETH available. I can sell it to you for the market price.
Plaintiff: Let's set some conditions. I will buy your 10 ETH if the price falls below $2000 by March 1st, 2025.
Defendant: Well, I'd prefer to just sell at market price, but I can hold it for you.
Plaintiff: No, I'm only willing to buy if it drops below $2000. That's my offer.
Defendant: Alright, I'll keep in touch and we can talk more about the details later.
Plaintiff: So we're clear - I'll only buy if it goes below $2000 by March 1st, 2025.
Defendant: I understand you want a good price. Let's talk soon about finalizing this.
