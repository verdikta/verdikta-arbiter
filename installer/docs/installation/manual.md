# Manual Installation

Manual installation is no longer supported. Please use the automated installation process.

## Use Automated Installation Instead

The Verdikta Arbiter Node now uses a fully automated installer that handles all configuration and setup steps. Manual installation has been deprecated to ensure consistent, reliable deployments.

**[â†’ Go to Automated Installation](automated.md)**

## Why Automated Only?

- **Reliability**: Automated process reduces configuration errors
- **Consistency**: All installations follow the same tested process  
- **Maintenance**: Single installation path is easier to support and update
- **Completeness**: Automated installer handles all 9 required steps

## Need Customization?

If you need to customize specific components after installation, you can:

- Re-run individual setup scripts from `installer/bin/`
- Modify configuration files in the installation directory
- Use the provided management scripts for service control

For advanced customization needs, please contact support or open a GitHub issue.
