## Core Components

### Chainlink Node

The Chainlink Node serves as the oracle infrastructure backbone:

- **Oracle Network Integration**: Connects to blockchain networks (currently Base Sepolia)
- **Job Management**: Executes predefined job specifications for arbitration requests
- **Data Security**: Handles cryptographic signing and secure data transmission
- **Reputation Tracking**: Maintains oracle performance metrics and reliability scores

### External Adapter

The External Adapter acts as a bridge between the blockchain and AI systems:

- **Request Translation**: Converts blockchain requests into AI-processable formats
- **Data Validation**: Ensures request integrity and parameter validation
- **Response Formatting**: Structures AI decisions for blockchain consumption
- **Error Handling**: Manages failures and provides fallback mechanisms

### AI Node

The AI Node is the core intelligence system:

- **Multi-Model Support**: Integrates OpenAI GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude models
- **Evidence Processing**: Retrieves and analyzes documents from IPFS
- **Decision Generation**: Produces structured arbitration decisions with reasoning
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation history and case context

### Smart Contracts

The on-chain components handle request lifecycle:

- **Operator Contract**: Manages oracle authorization and payment
- **Aggregator Contract**: Coordinates multiple oracles for consensus
- **Reputation System**: Tracks oracle performance and handles disputes

## Request Flow

### 1. Request Initiation

A smart contract initiates an arbitration request by calling the Chainlink Oracle:

```solidity
function requestArbitration(
    string memory caseDescription,
    string[] memory evidenceIPFSHashes,
    uint256 payment
) external {
    Chainlink.Request memory req = buildChainlinkRequest(
        jobId,
        address(this),
        this.fulfill.selector
    );
    req.add("caseDescription", caseDescription);
    req.addStringArray("evidence", evidenceIPFSHashes);
    sendChainlinkRequest(req, payment);
}
```

### 2. Oracle Processing

The Chainlink Node receives the request and triggers the job specification:

```toml
type = "directrequest"
schemaVersion = 1
name = "Verdikta Arbitration Job"
contractAddress = "OPERATOR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
maxTaskDuration = "5m"
observationSource = """
    decode_log   [type="ethabidecodelog"]
    decode_cbor  [type="cborparse"]
    fetch        [type="bridge" name="verdikta-adapter"]
    encode_data  [type="ethabiencode"]
    encode_tx    [type="ethabiencodetx"]
    submit_tx    [type="ethabsubmittx"]
"""
```

### 3. AI Processing

The AI Node processes the request through several stages:

#### Evidence Retrieval
```javascript
// Fetch evidence documents from IPFS
const evidenceDocuments = await Promise.all(
    evidenceHashes.map(hash => ipfs.cat(hash))
);
```

#### AI Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze case with multiple AI models
const decisions = await Promise.all([
    analyzeWithGPT4(caseDescription, evidence),
    analyzeWithClaude(caseDescription, evidence)
]);

// Consensus or confidence-based selection
const finalDecision = selectBestDecision(decisions);
```

#### Response Generation
```javascript
// Structure response for blockchain
const response = {
    decision: finalDecision.ruling,
    confidence: finalDecision.confidence,
    reasoning: finalDecision.explanation,
    evidenceReview: finalDecision.evidenceAnalysis
};
```

### 4. Response Delivery

The decision is returned to the requesting smart contract:

```solidity
function fulfill(
    bytes32 requestId,
    uint256 decision,
    uint256 confidence,
    string memory reasoning
) external recordChainlinkFulfillment(requestId) {
    // Process arbitration result
    emit ArbitrationComplete(requestId, decision, confidence);
}
```
