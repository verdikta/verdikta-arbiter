Funding Requirements:
1. User Wallet Funding & Approval:
   - Ensure your calling wallet has Base Sepolia LINK tokens (Faucet: https://faucets.chain.link).
   - Approve the Client Contract (0x084F2e0acf43aA4b48aD02a877Ec4E5E9Df3dc34) to spend LINK from your wallet.
   - Fee per request: 0.05 LINK. Approve enough for expected usage.

2. Chainlink Node Funding:
   - Your node needs Base Sepolia ETH to pay for transaction gas
   - Get Base Sepolia ETH from: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-sepolia-faucet
   - Find your node's address in the Chainlink UI: Key Management -> ETH Keys
   - Send at least 0.1 Base Sepolia ETH to your node's address

Testing the Setup:
1. Ensure your calling wallet has LINK and has approved the client contract.
2. Ensure the Chainlink node wallet is funded with Base Sepolia ETH.
3. Make a request to the client contract (e.g., using the example script).
4. Monitor job runs in the Chainlink UI.

About the Fixed Client Contract:
This client contract (AIChainlinkRequest) is specifically designed to be compatible
with the CompatibleOperator contract used in this setup. It properly handles the
callback format required for successful request fulfillment.
